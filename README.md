Lab: Comparing regression models
For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs.

Instructions
In this final lab, we will model our data. Import sklearn train_test_split and separate the data.
Try a simple linear regression with all the data to see whether we are getting good results.
Great! Now define a function that takes a list of models and train (and tests) them so we can try a lot of them without repeating code.
Use the function to check LinearRegressor and KNeighborsRegressor.
You can check also the MLPRegressor for this task!
Check and discuss the results.
